# ðŸ”’ Security Setup Guide

## GitHub Repository Secrets (Recommended)

### Why This is Safer:
- âœ… **No secrets in codebase** â€” avoid accidental commits
- âœ… **Scoped management** â€” admins can manage (not view) secrets; values are write-only
- âœ… **Governance** â€” use Environments with required reviewers and protected branches
- âœ… **Environment isolation** â€” separate secrets for dev/preview/prod
- âœ… **Automatic injection** â€” CI/CD receives masked env vars; logs redact values
### Required Repository Secrets:

## Local Development

For local development, keep the `.env` file but:
1. **Never commit it** (already in .gitignore)
2. Use `.env.example` to share structure with team
3. Each developer creates their own `.env`

## Production Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. Inject secrets as environment variables
2. Build with proper configuration
3. Deploy securely to Vercel

## Team Access

- **Repository secrets**: Only admins can view
- **Local .env**: Each developer manages their own
- Enable repository-level secret scanning and push protection: Turn on GitHub secret scanning (or integrate an equivalent thirdâ€‘party scanner) and enforce push protection/preâ€‘receive hooks to block commits containing secrets.
- Archived history is not a safe place for secrets: Any detected secrets must be rotated immediately and an incident noted; do not rely on archives or git history for access or distribution.

# Instructions for Conducting Productive Pull Request Reviews

This guide is intended to help you perform effective and constructive PR reviews.

1. Prepare for the Review
Ensure you have pulled the latest changes from the branch.
Familiarise yourself with the purpose of the PR by reading its description and linked issues.
Skim through the commit messages for context.

2. Use Copilot to Assist in Understanding
Allow Copilot to summarise or explain complex sections of code.
Ask Copilot for potential edge cases or scenarios the code might miss.
Request test suggestions from Copilot for untested logic.

3. Review Code Quality
Check for adherence to coding standards and style guidelines.
Look for potential bugs, security risks, or performance issues.
Confirm that code is modular, readable, and maintainable.

4. Evaluate Tests and Documentation
Ensure the PR includes sufficient test coverage.
Review documentation updates for clarity and completeness.
Use Copilot to suggest additional unit or integration tests if gaps are found.

5. Provide Constructive Feedback
Be specific and respectful in your comments.
Highlight both strengths and areas for improvement.
Use suggestions or code snippets to propose improvements where possible.

6. Approve or Request Changes
Approve the PR if it meets quality and functionality standards.
Request changes if there are critical issues, explaining why in detail.
Consider optional improvements as suggestions rather than blockers.

7. Follow Up
Respond promptly to the authorâ€™s updates or questions.
Ensure all discussions are resolved before merging.
Merge using the agreed strategy (squash, rebase, or merge commit).

# GitHub Project Setup Guide for VortexCore (Updated)

## What Changed Recently

- Added dynamic Edge middleware (CORS + security headers + JWT) and applied to Stripe, OpenAI functions, and ai-router.
- Enforced JWT + RBAC on Stripe Edge Function with ownership checks; added idempotency key handling.
- Tightened database privileges: revoked ALL from `anon` on key RLS tables; granted minimal privileges to `authenticated` (RLS still enforced).
- Fixed SSE headers and preflight handling for ai-router; unified CORS across functions.
- CI: Playwright OS deps installed; launch readiness computes PASS/FAIL from job results and fails on failures.

## Roadmap (Now â†’ Next)

- RBAC: Extend per-action roles on Stripe (admin/compliance for sensitive PAN access; self-service for user-owned resources). Add rate limiting and idempotency usage across mutations.
- CORS: Adopt middleware across all functions for consistent Origin reflection and `Vary: Origin`.
- RLS: Seed test users and add a deny-by-default validation matrix with executable SQL and/or API tests.
- Observability: Expand audit logs for AI and payments without PII.

### 3. Import Issues from Plan

Copy these commands and run them one by one to create issues:

```bash

gh issue create --title "[Phase 5] Complete Launch Readiness Checklist" --body "Feature completeness, security audit, performance benchmarks" --label "phase-5,launch,critical"
```

### 4. Configure Automation Rules

In your project settings, add these automation rules:

#### Rule 1: Auto-assign to phases
- **When**: Issue is created with label `phase-1`
- **Then**: Set status to `Phase 1: Testing`

#### Rule 2: Move completed items  
- **When**: Issue is closed
- **Then**: Set status to `Done`

#### Rule 3: Track progress
- **When**: Issue status changes to `In Progress`  
- **Then**: Set assignee to current user

### 5. Setup Project Labels

Create these labels in your repository:

**Phase Labels:**
- `phase-1` (Blue) - Foundation Testing & Validation
- `phase-2` (Green) - Feature Enhancement & Completion  
- `phase-3` (Red) - Security Hardening & Compliance
- `phase-4` (Purple) - User Testing & Feedback
- `phase-5` (Orange) - Launch Validation & Prep

**Priority Labels:**
- `critical` (Dark Red) - Must be completed for launch
- `high` (Red) - Important for launch success
- `medium` (Yellow) - Nice to have
- `low` (Light Gray) - Future enhancement

**Type Labels:**
- `testing` (Light Blue) - Testing related tasks
- `feature` (Green) - New feature development
- `security` (Red) - Security hardening
- `compliance` (Purple) - Regulatory compliance
- `performance` (Orange) - Performance optimization

### 6. Link to CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow (`launch-readiness-ci.yml`) will automatically run validation for each phase. Issues will be automatically updated based on test results.

### 7. Progress Tracking

**Daily Standup Questions:**
1. What Phase tasks did you complete yesterday?
2. What Phase tasks are you working on today?
3. Are there any blockers preventing phase completion?

**Weekly Phase Review:**
- Review phase completion percentage
- Identify blockers and dependencies  
- Adjust timeline if needed
- Celebrate completions

### 8. Success Metrics Dashboard

Track these metrics in your project:
- **Phase Completion**: % of tasks completed per phase
- **Timeline Adherence**: On-time vs delayed tasks
- **Quality Gates**: Pass/fail status of validation tests  
- **Risk Items**: High-priority issues and blockers

## Supabase and Vercel Setup

### Supabase
- Apply new migrations and deploy functions:
```bash
supabase link --project-ref <PROJECT_REF>
supabase db push
supabase functions deploy stripe ai-router openai-chat openai-assistant
```
- Ensure secrets are set: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.

### Vercel
- Add `.vercel` to `.gitignore` (already updated here) and link locally:
```bash
vercel link   # select existing org/project
vercel env pull .env  # optional: sync envs locally
```
- Build and preview to verify nothing breaks:
```bash
bun install
bun run build
vercel deploy --prebuilt
```

## RBAC, CORS, and RLS: Next Steps

### RBAC (Stripe)
- Enforce privileged roles for `get_card_details` (admin/compliance only) [done].
- Add rate limiting and require `x-idempotency-key` for all mutations.
- Consider an `issuer` role for card creation; otherwise restrict to self-service with ownership checks [done for reads/updates].

### CORS
- Middleware adopted for `stripe`, `ai-router`, `openai-chat`, `openai-assistant` [done].
- Adopt for any remaining functions to ensure dynamic Origin reflection and `Vary: Origin`.

### RLS
- Migration tightened privileges [done].
- Add seed data and validation scripts to prove deny-by-default across users/tenants.

## Testing Infrastructure

- E2E: Playwright configured with OS deps in CI; run locally with:
```bash
bunx playwright install-deps
bunx playwright install
bun run test:e2e
```
- New API tests:
  - `src/test/e2e/api-stripe.spec.ts` (401 without Authorization)
  - `src/test/e2e/api-cors.spec.ts` (OPTIONS preflight with Origin + Vary)
- Add protected-route and error-page tests as routes stabilize.

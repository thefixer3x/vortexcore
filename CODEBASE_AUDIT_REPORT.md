# VortexCore Codebase Audit Report

Generated: 2025-08-30T22:17:05Z

## Executive Summary

- Overall posture improved by enforcing JWT + RBAC on Stripe Edge Function, adding dynamic CORS middleware, tightening DB privileges, and strengthening CI readiness. Remaining work focuses on granular RBAC, rate limiting, and expanded RLS validation.

## Key Changes Since Last Report

- Implemented shared Edge middleware with dynamic CORS (reflect Origin), OPTIONS preflight, security headers, and JWT verification support.
- Hardened `stripe` Edge Function with authentication, basic RBAC (ownership checks via DB), and safer metadata handling.
- Added migration to REVOKE ALL from `anon` on key tables and grant minimal privileges to `authenticated` (RLS still enforced).
- Fixed SSE CORS and proxy buffering issues; added CORS preflight for `ai-router`.
- Cleaned and stabilized chat widget; robust SSE handling.
- CI updated to install Playwright OS deps and compute readiness from job results; gate now fails on any non-success.

## Risk Assessment

- Previous critical issues around secret handling and unauthenticated Stripe actions have been mitigated. Risk now primarily relates to completeness of RBAC granularity, rate limiting, and comprehensive RLS coverage.

## Findings (Snapshot)

- Stripe function now requires Authorization; sensitive actions verify ownership via `virtual_cards` table and return 401/403 appropriately.
- Database privileges to `anon` revoked for wallets, conversations, child_profiles, transactions, ai_chat_sessions, vortex_settings, stripe_customers.
- `ai-router` SSE responses include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`, and `X-Accel-Buffering` with OPTIONS preflight.
- Deployed CI ensures Playwright system deps present; launch readiness reflects actual job outcomes.

## Next Actions

- Add per-action RBAC to Stripe (e.g., admin-only for some operations), rate limiting, and idempotency keys enforcement on mutations.
- Expand RLS test matrix with seeded test users and explicit denial checks.
- Reflect dynamic `Origin` across all functions consistently; add `Vary: Origin` headers universally.

## Files Touched

- `supabase/functions/_shared/middleware.ts` (new, dynamic CORS + JWT)
- `supabase/functions/stripe/index.ts` (auth + RBAC)
- `supabase/functions/ai-router/index.ts` (SSE headers + preflight)
- `supabase/migrations/2025-08-30_tighten_privileges.sql` (privileges)
- `supabase/config.toml` (verify_jwt per function)
- `src/components/ai/OpenAIChat.tsx` (stabilized streaming)
- `.github/workflows/launch-readiness-ci.yml` (deps + readiness gate)
- `.github/workflows/deploy-with-secrets.yml` (scoped env)
